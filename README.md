# bakkesmod for steam deck

this is a bottles config that contains epic games, rocket league, and bakkes mod.

add bottles using discover
In bottles:
you will need to install epic using the install programs button within the bottle then log in.
then install rocket league in epic. 
bakkes mod should be installed if it is not you will need to install it in this bottle only.
after all is installed you'll see all three programs will be launchable in this bottle.
launch all programs independently in desktop mode to make sure they're all working correctly. 

you need to set bakkes mod to run in safe mode (launch bakkes click settings enable mode).
also disable hide when minimized.
you need to play through the whole rocket league intro in desktop mode.
you need to update epic. go to settings in epic and click update also install online services.

after you've done this open protonup qt (in discover).
install for steam.
add version steam-play-none main.

now open steam. At the top left click games, add non steam game, add bottles.
find bottles in your library and set compatibility to steam-play-none.
(this will run bottles with no compatibility layers added.)

make sure everything's updated. bakkes, rocket, and epic.

now you can go to game mode and launch bottles.
open our bottle and launch bakkesmod then launch rocket league. 

to use bakkesmod:
normally you'd press f2 to open the menu. if you want to change this go to controller settings for bottles and edit layout. 
I use the left trackpad for bakkes menu functions. 

configure all your in game setting.
my video setting:
you don't have to use this but it runs decently for me.
window settings:
1280 x 800 borderless vsync-off
basic settings:
AA-off Rquality-off Rdetail-custom FPS-120
advanced settings:
texture-high world-high particle-high effect-low
highqualityshaders-check transparentgoalpost-check
all others unchecked. 

everything should work correctly now.
